# Cube Worlds Whitepaper

## Introduction
Cube Worlds is an innovative text-based RPG game integrated within a Telegram bot named [@cube_worlds_bot](http://t.me/cube_worlds_bot). This open-world game offers players a unique experience where their decisions significantly impact the game environment. Players can interact with both NPCs and other players, creating a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.

## $CUBE Token Economy

### Token Acquisition
1. **Initial Stage**: $CUBE jettons can be obtained through interaction with [@cube_worlds_bot](http://t.me/cube_worlds_bot).
2. **Post-Mint Stage**: After the jetton contract is minted, $CUBE can be acquired by sending TON to the smart contract.

### Token Distribution Schedule
The distribution rate of $CUBE tokens per 1 TON will change over time, following a halving schedule:

| Time Period | $CUBE per TON |
|-------------|---------------|
| Initial     | 50,000        |
| After 3 months | 25,000     |
| After 6 months | 12,500     |
| After 9 months | 6,250      |
| After 12 months | 3,125     |
| (continues halving every 3 months) |

This halving mechanism ensures a controlled distribution of tokens over time, potentially increasing scarcity and value.

### Allocation of Received TON
The TON received from $CUBE token sales will be allocated as follows:

1. **50% for Operational Expenses**: 
   - Team salaries
   - Hosting costs
   - Service fees (e.g., ChatGPT, Pinata, Stable Diffusion)

2. **50% for $CUBE Token Support**: 
   - Buying tokens from the market to support the token price
   - Token burning or other price stabilization actions

This balanced allocation ensures the project's sustainability while also supporting the value of the $CUBE token.

## Gameplay Mechanics

   - Players can also obtain various in-game items that can be minted as NFTs.
   - These NFT items can be traded or sold in the open market, providing additional value to player actions.

*The limits and cost of every action in $CUBE will be expensive for our first players to reduce our costs of using LLM until we collect data sufficient to train our own specific game model*

## NPC Creation and Economy

### Creating NPCs
1. Users can create and submit NPCs for moderation.
2. Approved NPCs are minted as NFTs and sent to auction.
3. The creator receives 30% of the final sale price.
